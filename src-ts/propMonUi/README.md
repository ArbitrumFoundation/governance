# Proposal monitor UI
Monitors the core and treasury governors for new proposals, then tracks them through each of their stages.

The UI has two components:
1. Proposal Monitor CLI - this is a long running service that generates a json file of proposal events
2. propMonUI.html - a basic UI that displays the json file generated by the proposal monitor service

Note: You can run via ts-node installed globally, or compile with tsc and run with node.

To run the Proposal Monitor - from project root:
```
yarn
yarn build
ts-node ./src-ts/proposalMonitorCli.ts --jsonOutputLocation ./src-ts/propMonUi/proposalState.json --l1RpcUrl https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/<your id here> --govChainRpcUrl https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc --novaRpcUrl https://nova.arbitrum.io/rpc --coreGovernorAddress 0xf07DeD9dC292157749B6Fd268E37DF6EA38395B9 --treasuryGovernorAddress 0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4 --pollingIntervalSeconds 1
