# AIP: ArbOS Version 11

# Constitutional

## Abstract

This AIP introduces a number of improvements to Arbitrum chains, including support for the EVM Shanghai upgrade and the PUSH0 opcode, along with miscellaneous bug fixes. These improvements are now audited and ready for adoption, including by Arbitrum Orbit chains, Arbitrum One, and Arbitrum Nova. This proposal concerns the latter two, as they are governed by the Arbitrum DAO. On a high level an ArbOS upgrade can be seen as Arbitrum's equivalent of a hardfork - more can be read about the subject over in https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-arbos-upgrades/19695

## Changes Included

### 1. EVM Shanghai support (including the PUSH0 opcode)

Recent versions of go-ethereum already includes support for the changes to the EVM made in the Shanghai L1 upgrade, but we need to enable them for Arbitrum chains. Instead of using a time based activation, it’s better to activate support based on the ArbOS version, which makes sure that even if the upgrade is delayed, Shanghai support will take effect uniformly and without causing divergences with out of date node software.

### 2. Retryable fixes

Retryable fees previously always used the network fee account, instead of also using the infrastructure fee account. The infrastructure fee account should be paid fees from the basefee, and the network fee account should be paid any surplus fees when the gas price is elevated. That was correctly implemented for normal transactions, but retryables only dealt with the network fee account. Retryable redemption also reported an incorrect gas usage in the block header. This matters to Arbitrum Nova, where the infrastructure fee account pays out some fees to the Data Availability Committee members, but the network fee account does not.

### 3. Fix the chain owner list returned by precompile

This change doesn’t affect the actual chain owner set, but the list being returned by the ArbOwnerPublic precompile was incorrect for Arbitrum Nova due to an internal ArbOS issue. To be clear, this does not affect who was able to make chain owner actions. As intended, only the DAO is able to make chain owner actions on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. This change only affects the list of chain owners presented by the ArbOwnerPublic precompile.

### 4. Fix some precompile methods taking up all gas when reverting

Some precompile methods such as ArbSys’s arbBlockHash method took up all gas when reverting. That meant that if a transaction called arbBlockHash with an out-of-range block number, it’d use up all the gas when reverting.

### 5. Create missing precompile methods to view some L1 pricing parameters

The L1RewardReceipient and L1RewardRate were previously not exposed via precompiles. This change adds methods to get them to ArbGasInfo so that the current chain configuration can be easily checked.

### 6. Fix the possibility of a staticcall from the owner to ArbOwner emitting a log

This shouldn’t matter in practice, but it was theoretically for a staticcall from the chain owner to the ArbOwner precompile to emit a log. In the EVM, staticcalls should never be able to emit logs. This PR fixes the Arbitrum precompile logic to disallow emitting logs in staticcall contexts.

https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1562

### 7. Fix default L1 pricing params

This shouldn’t matter for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, because these parameters were already corrected in [AIP-7](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-7-arbitrum-one-governance-parameter-fixes/15920). However, it’s included in ArbOS version 11 so that any Arbitrum Orbit chains automatically get the correct parameters.

## Implementation

The canonical version of ArbOS 11 this proposal aims to adopt is implemented in the Arbitrum Nitro git commit hash  `df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d`

That commit builds a WASM module root of `0xf4389b835497a910d7ba3ebfb77aa93da985634f3c052de1290360635be40c4a`, which is a hash of the code that’s put on-chain for fraud proofs. You can verify this WASM module root on a x86_64 computer (i.e. not on ARM which builds slightly different symbol names) with Docker setup by checking out the previously mentioned commit of the nitro repository, running `git submodule update --init --recursive`, and then running `docker build . --target module-root-calc --tag wavm-machine && docker run --rm wavm-machine cat /workspace/target/machines/latest/module-root.txt` This uses Docker to perform a reproducible build of the WebAssembly code used in fraud proofs, and outputs its hash.

### Verifying the ArbOS Code Difference

The current ArbOS version used on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova is ArbOS 10, corresponding to the Arbitrum Nitro `consensus-v10` git tag. You can verify this by running the previously mentioned steps to build the WASM module root on that git tag, which produces the WASM module root `0x6b94a7fc388fd8ef3def759297828dc311761e88d8179c7ee8d3887dc554f3c3`, which is what the rollup contract’s `wasmModuleRoot()` method returns for both Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.

To audit the code difference from ArbOS 10 to ArbOS 11, you could simple generate a full nitro diff with `git diff consensus-v10 df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d` (and also generate a diff of the go-ethereum submodule mentioned in that nitro diff). However, that includes a lot of code that isn’t part of the WASM module root. To filter down to just the replay binary which defines the state transition function, you can start by generating a list of files in the nitro and go-ethereum repositories included by the replay binary in either ArbOS 10 or ArbOS 11 with bash:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e
mkdir -p ~/tmp # this script uses ~/tmp as scratch space and output
# this script should be run in the nitro repository
git checkout df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d
git submodule update --init --recursive
make solgen
go list -f "{{.Deps}}" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '[]' | sed 's/ /\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/' | sed 's@github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/@@' | while read dir; do find "$dir" -type f -name '*.go' -maxdepth 1; done | grep -v '_test\\.go
```

Now, `~/tmp/replay-binary-dependencies.txt` contains a list of dependencies of the replay binary that were present in ArbOS 10 or 11. To use that to generate a smaller diff of the nitro repository, you can run:

```
git diff consensus-v10 df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d -- cmd/replay $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-nitro-dependencies.txt)
```

For the go-ethereum submodule, you can first find out what go-ethereum commit ArbOS 10 and 11 used:

```
$ git ls-tree consensus-v10 go-ethereum                                                                                                                                                                                           128 ↵
160000 commit 941aa323e5cbbde1d5806eb4e3dd70553c5a1298  go-ethereum
$ git ls-tree df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d go-ethereum
160000 commit abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de  go-ethereum
```

Those commit hashes are the go-ethereum commit hashes pinned by each nitro commit. Then, you can again use `git diff` and the files generated by the earlier script to generate a diff limited to code used by the replay binary:

```
git diff 941aa323e5cbbde1d5806eb4e3dd70553c5a1298 abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt)
```

This diff also includes the diff between upstream go-ethereum versions v1.10.25 and v1.11.6, as ArbOS 10 used the former and ArbOS 11 uses the latter. To filter out that difference, you can use this tool to find the intersection of two git diffs: https://gist.github.com/PlasmaPower/795af590f88cfb5e21c5ad9b8a32afdf

We can use that to find the intersection of the diff of ArbOS 11’s go-ethereum against ArbOS 10’s go-ethereum and the diff of ArbOS 11’s go-etheruem against upstream go-ethereum v1.11.6:

```
git diff 941aa323e5cbbde1d5806eb4e3dd70553c5a1298 abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-10-vs-11-geth.diff
git diff v1.11.6 abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-11-vs-upstream-geth.diff
diff-intersection.py ~/tmp/arbos-10-vs-11-geth.diff ~/tmp/arbos-11-vs-upstream-geth.diff
```
In addition, you can pass the following arguments to `diff-intersection.py` to ignore files that are included by the replay binary but whose components are not used: `--ignore-files 'core/blockchain*.go' arbitrum_types/txoptions.go 'rawdb/**' 'rpc/**'`

Note that by default, `diff-intersection.py` does a line based intersection. To instead do an intersection based on chunks in the diff, known as hunks in git terminology, you can add the `--only-hunks` flag.
