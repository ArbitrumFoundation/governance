    ///         1.  Use a more persistent record that a specific upgrade is taking place. This adds
    ///             a lot of complexity, as we have multiple layers of calldata wrapping each other to
    ///             define the multiple transactions that occur in a round-trip upgrade. So safely recording
    ///             execution of the would be difficult and brittle.
    ///         2.  Override this protection and just ensure elsewhere that the executor only has the
    ///             the correct entrypoints and access control. We've gone for this option.
